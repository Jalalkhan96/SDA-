# Software Architecture Solutions with Code

This repository provides solutions to common software architecture problems with practical code examples. These solutions help manage scalability, complexity, fault tolerance, data consistency, and security challenges in distributed systems, particularly in microservices-based architectures.

## Scalability Issues

**Problem:**  
As the system grows, it becomes harder to manage and scale individual components.  

**Examples:**
- Overloaded servers due to sudden traffic spikes (e.g., during a popular show launch).
- Database bottlenecks when handling millions of simultaneous read/write operations.

**Solution:**  
Adopt horizontal scaling, use distributed databases, and implement load balancers.  

### Code Example: Load Balancer using NGINX

Create an NGINX configuration to distribute traffic among multiple backend servers.

```nginx
# nginx.conf
http {
    upstream backend_servers {
        server backend1.example.com;
        server backend2.example.com;
        server backend3.example.com;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend_servers;
        }
    }
}
