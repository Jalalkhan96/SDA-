# Netflix Architecture Overview

This document outlines the key architectural components and strategies that power Netflix's world-class streaming platform.

---

## 1. Microservices Architecture
Netflix transitioned from a monolithic architecture to **microservices**, with each service handling a specific business function, such as:
- User recommendations
- Streaming
- Billing

### **Benefits**:
- Independent development, deployment, and scaling
- Fault isolation: Issues in one service don't affect others
- High agility and faster delivery cycles

---

## 2. AWS Cloud Infrastructure
Netflix leverages **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** as its primary cloud platform to enable:
- Scalability to support millions of users worldwide
- Global content delivery through AWS's extensive network of data centers
- Reliable storage and compute services

---

## 3. Content Delivery Network (CDN) - Open Connect
Netflix developed its own **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**, called **Open Connect**, to efficiently deliver video content to users.

### **Features**:
- Local caching at Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
- Reduced latency and bandwidth costs
- High-performance video streaming

---

## 4. Resilience and Availability
Netflix ensures high availability and fault tolerance with:
- **Chaos Engineering**: Tools like **Chaos Monkey** simulate failures to test system resilience.
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures by stopping downstream service calls during outages.
- **Load Balancing**: Dynamically distribute traffic across servers to maintain performance.

---

## 5. Data Storage and Management
Netflix uses a variety of databases tailored to specific use cases:
- **Cassandra (NoSQL)**: Large-scale distributed storage
- **MySQL**: Relational data
- **DynamoDB**: AWS-specific storage needs
- **S3**: Media file storage

---

## 6. API Gateway
An **API Gateway** serves as the single entry point for client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices.

### **Benefits**:
- Simplifies communication between clients and services
- Centralizes authentication and logging

---

## 7. Big Data and Personalization
Netflix leverages big data and machine learning for recommendations and personalization.

### **Tools Used**:
- **Apache Kafka**: Real-time data streaming
- **Apache Hadoop/Spark**: Big data processing
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Optimize content recommendations and streaming quality

---

## 8. DevOps and CI/CD
Netflix fosters a strong **DevOps culture** with:
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipelines for fast, reliable releases
- Automation of testing, building, and deployment processes

---

## 9. Observability and Monitoring
Netflix ensures real-time monitoring and observability through:
- **Atlas**: Telemetry system for time-series data
- **Eureka**: Service registry for microservices
- **Spinnaker**: Deployment automation and monitoring tool

---

## 10. User Experience (Frontend Architecture)
Netflixâ€™s frontend architecture is designed for seamless cross-platform support:
- **React** and **Node.js**: Web applications
- Native development: Mobile platforms (iOS and Android)
- Optimized UI for smart TVs and streaming devices
