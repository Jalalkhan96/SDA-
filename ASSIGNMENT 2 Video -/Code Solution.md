## 1. Scalability Issues

**Problem:**  
As the system grows, it becomes harder to manage and scale individual components.  

**Examples:**
- Overloaded servers due to sudden traffic spikes (e.g., during a popular show launch).
- Database bottlenecks when handling millions of simultaneous read/write operations.

**Solution:**  
Adopt horizontal scaling, use distributed databases, and implement load balancers.  

### Code Example: Load Balancer using NGINX

Create an NGINX configuration to distribute traffic among multiple backend servers.

```nginx
# nginx.conf
http {
    upstream backend_servers {
        server backend1.example.com;
        server backend2.example.com;
        server backend3.example.com;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend_servers;
        }
    }
}
